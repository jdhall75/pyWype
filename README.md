## pyWipe

A text-based tool to securely wipe hard drives written to work with Python 2 & 3.

*diskWipe.py* works as is in Python 2.7 
The idea here is to enhance the program in Python 2.7 first, then add support for Python 3.4. Eventually, it would be nice if this program could functionally do what OS X's Disk Utility--secure erase option--does:
